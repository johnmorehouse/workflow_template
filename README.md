# Project Template

This repo is designed to serve as a template for projects in R. This repo was inspired by [Patrick Schratz's](https://github.com/pat-s/pathogen-modeling) pathogen modeling repo. 


## Packages Used

2. [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)

  - Displays results/makes research easily shareable.[This](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/workflow_template/e8d0993511c78af43c3633e816d598de7e623dc3/docs/example_report.html) page was created with `workflowr` and `drake`.
